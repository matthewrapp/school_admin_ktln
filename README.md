# Overview

Working in sprints, allows for me to learn how to be as productive as I can, with the school and knowledge I have now. That being said, I really wanted to learn Kotlin and understand it's syntax and how to write a console application in it, in hopes to write a simple Android application soon after.

I took the program (that I wrote in Java) from last sprint and rewrote it in Kotlin, plus added some more functionality and logic to it. It was really nice to be able to compare and contrast both programming languages while writing the same program. It really helped me learn more about both (Java and Kotlin).
